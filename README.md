# dcat-ap_validator

This software performs the validation of DCAT-AP rdf files.
Validation is performed through a SPARQL query loaded via Javascript.
The SPARQL query contains several rules which are based on those available here:
https://github.com/nvdk/OpenDataSupport/tree/master/odip.opendatasupport.eu/validation_queries

Each rule has been documented with <a href="https://github.com/ldodds/sparql-doc">sparql-doc</a> annotations and validated with the <a href="http://www.sparql.org/query-validator.html">sparql validator</a>.

All the rules are stored in the <b>rules</b> folder. For almost each rule a test and a test data have been created. Tests are located in tests folder and they are based on casperjs, test data are locate in tests-data folder and they are xml/rdf files to be tested against. 

<h2>Installation instructions</h2>
The validator is an HTML page, containing a single <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL</a> SELECT query to implement the validation logic and a few lines of JavaScript to call the triple store. To execute the SPARQL script it requires an instance of <a href="http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/index.html">Fuseki</a>. You can easily run Fuseki as a local instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download a Fuseki binary distribution (e.g. jena-fuseki1-1.1.2-distribution.zip) from an <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/jena/">Apache mirror site</a>.</li>
<li>Unpack the binary distribution to your a <code>FUSEKI_HOME</code> folder of your choice.</li>
<li>Unpack the 'dcat-ap_validator.zip' distribution in the <code>FUSEKI_HOME</code> folder. Keep the folder structure in tact. Verify that the file 'dcat-ap_validator_validator.html' is in the <code>FUSEKI_HOME/pages</code> folder.</li>
<li>Fuseki requires a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jre-7-download-432155.html">Java Runtime Environment</a> to be installed on your machine</li>
</ol>
<h2>User guide</h2>
<ol>
<li>Launch Fuseki using the command in 'dcat-ap_validator_launchfuseki.cmd':
<code>java -jar fuseki-server.jar --update --port=3030 --mem /dcat-ap_validator</code></li>
<li>Direct your browser to <a href="http://localhost:3030/dcat-ap_validator.html">http://localhost:3030/dcat-ap_validator.html</a></li>
<li>You get this page from Fuseki's internal web server.</li>
<li>Select one or more RDF files that contain the software metadata to validate. Optionally, also controlled vocabularies can be incldued to verify correct usage of them.</li>
<li>Optionally, you can set another SPARQL endpoint, output format, or even modify the SPARQL validation query. </li>
<li>Hit the 'Validate' button. Fuseki returns the validation results within seconds.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Development</h2>
The development process is based on:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, which executes the build.xml</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ldodds/sparql-doc">sparql-doc</a> 0.0.4 which generates HTML documentation based on rules (SPARQL queries). Sparql-doc is installed on Windows machine after <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/en">Railsinstaller</a> 2.2.5 for Ruby 1.9 (required by sparql-doc) with the command:<code>gem install sparql-doc</code></li>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/jslint4java/">jslint4java</a> 2.0.5 which validates the javascript used by the validator accordingly to JSLint rules.</li>
<li><a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> 1.6.2.1 to automate the launch of Ant, sparql-doc, Jslint and get the code from Github, Jenkins has been installed with the Violation plugin to monitor the JSLint error in the Javascript </li>
</ol>
